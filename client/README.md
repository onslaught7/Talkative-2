# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<!-- 
git checkout master
git pull origin master -->

Apply large file direct sharing, a file being uploaded from one side and is directly being accessed on the other
Apply state of the art encryption to messages

Problem I faced

Channel messages were pulled whili pulling in messages for dm causing undefined users to occur
